* Overview
** Goal
   There exist some library upgrade which would break client. Among them lots of cases are due to
   the co-evolution of libraries. We aim to find those bug-induced upgrade.

   Given a client (and its dependencies), generate a patch on POM to upgrade a certain library / certain libraries,
   so that some client tests (used to pass) would fail with upgraded dependencies.

** Na√Øve approach / groundtruth
   Upgrade each library and run tests.
   Our approach should be more efficient than this brute-force approach.
** Current idea
   To reduce the cycles of upgrade-runtest,
   cluster / partition all dependencies (maybe include transitive) as weakly-connected (directed) sub-graphs,
   so that multiple combinations can be pruned after one upgrade-runtest cycle.

* Partition strategy / ideas
** Mine references used in POMs
   Those library whose versions are configured use the same reference should have strong
   connection.
** Static analysis on client
   Find highly-related libraries, based on their mutual presence and/or data dependency in a
   client method.
   
* Interaction Pattern (where conflicts happen)
+ JAR ?
+ POM: 
+ data: e.g. jacoco-core, jacoco-report
+ client usage

* Future Plan
+ Upgrade pairs to find conflicts caused by two (or more) dependencies
